# OpenTyper

The OpenTyper perspective is aimed at MALDI-TOF MS users. Currently it allows to load mass spectras directly and displays a peak list of the selected spectra.

Some file format converters, such as Bruker Flex, filter spectra by default, which you might want to disable under preferences. The profile mass spectrum view can be enabled Mass Selective Detector (MSD) settings.
